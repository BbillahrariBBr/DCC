        <b>Introduction to the College</b>
At the beginning of the 21st Century, today's Dhaka City College, situated at the center of the capital's Dhanmondi Road, was established in 1957 as Dhaka City Night College.
Whose journey started in the limited range of West and High School, today its long standing and prominent position in the education system of Bangladesh has passed through a long period of time. After staying in Dhaka College campus for some time in the 60's, the college started its work in '70 today.
Soon after taking over the charge of Principal Professor Hafizuddin in 1977, a new journey of modern Dhaka City College started. Professor Md. Hafiz Uddin passed away on December 29, 2009, after working long after 33 years of his success as a Principal. We call Principal Md. Hafiz Uddin as the 'Rupakar of Modern Dhaka City College'.
Along with the former Dhaka Divisional Commissioner, Alam Khan, the former chairman of the college governing body, the construction of two more large buildings were built in 1989. Meanwhile, the construction of another building is over. Progressive branch started for girls after leaving the night division in 1991. Throughout the introduction of non-political students-council, a breakthrough was initiated in 1992 for conducting educational activities of the college. Meanwhile, two separate places were purchased for the college's own financing. A 13-katha adjoining a college on which a 6-storey building has been constructed. The other is one bigha place in Dhanmondi 3 / A road. The construction of the six-storey building was completed. Also, the benefits of introduction of semester courses and examination methods at graduate and higher secondary level have been present since 1980. Evidence of this is that since 1984 many universities and university level examinations have been ranked on the merit list of a large number of students each year. In recent times, the Grading Method Board examination is one of the main evidence of GPA-5 of the highest number of students in the field of business education and science.

In the 1995-96 academic year, the introduction of higher courses has added new dimensions to the college's advancement. Honors and MBBS in Management, Accounting and Marketing The college is progressing towards achieving higher education through the 1st episode and the last episode. Honors in English from 1997-98 academic year, 1998 BSC from Education Year (Honors) Computer Science and Engineering, BBA And BBSE from the 2003 -04 academic year (Honors) Finance and Banking courses are introduced. Education for B.Sc. (Honor) Economy has started in the 2012-2013 session. Regular MBA from 2004 Courses have been introduced. In order to provide quality human resources by providing quality education, the instructions of the Board and the National University and the principles and procedures followed in the universities of the developed world have been introduced in the college in the light of their own methods of teaching.

The renowned medical practitioner, former Health Advisor to Honorable Prime Minister and Honorable Education Personality Professor Dr. Syed Modasser Ali is currently being managed by the efficient management and supervision of the respected members of the Governing Body, with sincere effort and proper guidance and supervision. The effective governance of the competent authority, the sincere, honest and qualified teacher-lecture, the favorable environment of the beautiful, transparent and expected education and the use of well-planned progressive education have made the college a proud institution today. We firmly believe that Dhaka City College is playing a positive role in national progress by spreading education through the development of self-confidence and human spirit.
